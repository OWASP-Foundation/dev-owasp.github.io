![Global Board Class of 2019](/assets/images/web/board.png)

The OWASP Foundation Global Board is comprised of seven elected members who serve for two-year terms. Each Fall, membership votes to elect new leadership for the Foundation. Generally our Board meets monthly and meetings are open to the public. The Global Board sets the strategic direction of the Foundation, its policies, and sets governance and leadership roles. The [Global Board Home Page](/www-board/) has information about upcoming meetings, former meeting minutes, Board decisions, contact information, and other general information. Pictured above the Board class of 2019.

## Staff

Under the direction of the Executive Director, staff implements programs and policies of the Foudation while collaborating with members on OWASP Projects, Chapters, Events, and initiatives.

Each year the staff works with the Global Board to establish an [Operating Plan](/www-staff/operating-plan/2020) and Budget. The work efforts of our staff are tracked publicly on the [Staff Projects Page](/www-staff/) along with [upcoming milestones](/www-staff/milestones).
